## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# At minimum, you'll need Google API keys for full functionality
```

### 2. Start Development Environment
```bash
# Option 1: Using Make (recommended)
make setup    # First time setup
make start    # Start all services

# Option 2: Using Docker Compose directly
docker-compose up
```

### 3. Access Your Applications
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **pgAdmin**: http://localhost:5050 (admin@travelplanner.com / admin)
- **Redis Commander**: http://localhost:8081

### 4. Run Database Migrations
```bash
make db-migrate
# or
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

## 🔑 Required API Keys

To get full functionality, you'll need these API keys:

### Google APIs
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable "Google+ API" and "Places API"
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add `http://localhost:3000` to authorized origins
6. Add keys to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-places-api-key
   ```

### Optional: AWS S3 (for file storage)
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Run Health Checks
```bash
# Check all services
make health

# Or manually
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
# All tests
make test

# Backend only
make test-backend

# Frontend only  
make test-frontend
```

### 3. Check Code Quality
```bash
# Run linting
make lint

# Auto-fix formatting
make format
```
