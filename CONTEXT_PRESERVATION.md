# TravelPlanner Project - Complete Context Preservation Document

This document captures all essential information about the TravelPlanner project setup to preserve context before Linear MCP integration activation.

## üìã Project Overview and Status

### Core Concept
**TravelPlanner** is a collaborative travel planning platform that eliminates endless group chats and decision paralysis when groups try to choose travel destinations and create city-by-city itineraries together.

### Key Value Proposition
- **City-first Planning**: Focus on city-level planning vs. country-level
- **Democratic Voting**: True collaboration with clear ownership where everyone's voice is heard
- **Flexible Groups**: Works for solo planning or group collaboration
- **Fast Decisions**: Simple voting tools eliminate decision paralysis

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Complete foundation setup finished**
- ‚úÖ **All Linear tickets from foundation epic completed**
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready development environment established**
- ‚úÖ **Ready for feature development phase**

2. **Database schema** with all models and relationships defined
3. **API route structure** with endpoint definitions (implementation pending)
4. **Frontend component architecture** with routing and layouts
5. **Docker development environment** with all services configured
6. **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions workflows
7. **Deployment configuration** for Railway platform
8. **Documentation** covering all aspects of development and deployment

### What Needs Implementation (Feature Development Phase)
1. **API endpoint implementations** (currently TODO placeholders)
2. **Google OAuth integration** (client keys needed)
3. **Frontend API integration** (service layer implementations)
4. **Business logic** in service layers
5. **Comprehensive testing** (frameworks configured, tests needed)
6. **Google Places API integration** for city search

### Critical Integration Points
- **Google OAuth 2.0** for user authentication
- **Google Places API** for city search and validation
- **Real-time features** (WebSocket integration for voting - nice-to-have)
- **Email notifications** for invitations and updates

## üîë Required API Keys and External Dependencies

### Google APIs (Critical)
Required for full functionality:
1. **Google Cloud Console** project setup needed
2. **Google+ API** (for OAuth) - must be enabled
3. **Google Places API** (for city search) - must be enabled
4. **OAuth 2.0 credentials** with localhost authorized origins
5. **Environment variables** to configure:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-places-api-key
   ```

### Optional but Recommended
- **AWS S3** for file storage (trip photos, user avatars)
- **SendGrid/Mailgun** for email notifications
- **Railway** account for production deployment

## üéØ User Preferences and Context

### Development Approach
- **Quality over speed** - 1 month timeline is aspirational, not a hard deadline
- **Production-ready setup** preferred over MVP shortcuts
- **Full testing and documentation** emphasis
- **Clean architecture** with separation of concerns

### Feature Priorities
1. **Group collaboration** is the primary use case
2. **Solo planning** capability as secondary feature
3. **Real-time features** are nice-to-have for MVP
4. **City-level focus** vs. country-level planning

### Technical Preferences
- **Type safety** throughout (TypeScript, Pydantic)
- **Modern tooling** (React 18, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0)
- **Docker-first** development environment
- **Comprehensive testing** with good coverage

## üìà Linear Integration Context

### Current Status
- **Linear MCP server** configured but requires session restart to activate
- **GitHub integration** ready for Linear ticket references
- **Commit message format** established for Linear ticket tracking
- **Branch naming convention** prepared for Linear workflow

### Next Development Workflow
1. **Linear tickets** will drive feature development
2. **API keys** will be provided via Linear tickets by user
3. **Feature branches** named as: `feature/TRAVEL-123-trip-creation`
4. **Commit messages** with Linear references: `TRAVEL-123: Add trip creation`

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps After Session Restart

### Priority 1: Linear Integration
1. Restart Claude Code session to activate Linear MCP
2. Verify Linear workspace connection
3. Review existing Linear tickets for feature development priorities

### Priority 2: API Key Configuration
1. Get Google API keys from user via Linear tickets
2. Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials with proper redirect URIs
3. Test Google integration in development environment

### Priority 3: Feature Implementation
1. Begin implementing actual API endpoints (currently TODO placeholders)
2. Implement Google OAuth flow in frontend
3. Build city search functionality with Google Places API
4. Develop collaborative trip planning features

### Priority 4: Testing and Quality
1. Write comprehensive tests for implemented features
2. Set up monitoring and logging for production
3. Conduct thorough testing of collaborative workflows
